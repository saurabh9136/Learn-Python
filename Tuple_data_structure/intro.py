"""
Tuples in Python
A built-in data type that lets us create immutable sequences of values.

tup = (87, 64, 33, 95,76) #tup[0], tup[1]..
tup[0] = 43 #NOT allowed in python
"""

# To declare a Tuple use ()

tuple = (3, 2, 5, 1)

#correct way to declare single value tuple
singleTuple = (4,) # help compiler understand better, compalsory

nullTup = ()

print(type(tuple))
